# Express.js : Note Taker App 

## Description
The Note Taker is an application that allows a user to take notes/submit reminders to themselves via an online website. Users will be able to Give the note a title, write however much they desire, and then save the note. Users will also be able to see past notes in the side bar to the left, and can delete notes that they no longer need. 

## Installation 
As this application is rendered on a web browser, all a user needs to do is click on the link to be directed to the application. However, if you wish to take a look at the code, it's recommended that you have `Node.js` installed on to your device. Once it's installed, you can copy this repository on to your own device and open it up in a program like Visual Code Studio. 

Opening the terminal under the **main folder** of the repository, run the commands `npm install` and `node server.js` to view the code in a local host tab. As this application runs with npm packages, an install is a must for it to function properly.

## Visuals
Here are a couple of screenshots of the main page of the application and the note portion of the application:

## Acknowledgments
As always, a big thanks to my peers, my teachers, and the boat load of repositories I snooped through to get an idea of where I went wrong. I truly appreciate every single one I browsed through, otherwise I may have just yanked out all of my hair and called it a day. I'm forever grateful of all the past students and wonderful coders still keeping their projects up for novice coders like myself to look through for clarity.
